		<b>SQLite Program</b>
		<br><br>
		This is the location of the sqlite program. The sqlite program needs to be installed
		in order for RazorSQL to be able to access SQLite.
		<br><br>
		Mac OS X Tiger (10.4) has sqlite preinstalled in the following location:
		<br><br>
		/usr/bin/sqlite3
		<br><br>
		For Windows, RazorSQL ships with sqlite3.exe in the sqlite\win folder under the
		RazorSQL install directory.
		<br><br>
		For Linux, the sqlite bin file will need to be available.  Use the Browse
		button to tell RazorSQL where the .bin file is located.
