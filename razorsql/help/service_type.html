		<b>RazorSQL JDBC Bridge Type</b>
		<br><br>
		There are two options when using the RazorSQL JDBC Bridge to access databases, Interface and Driver.
		<br><br>
		If using the Interface option, the RazorSQL JDBC Bridge will obtain a connection to the database by
		calling the Interface Method of the Interface Class.  The Interface Class must be provided and be
		accessible to the RazorSQL JDBC Bridge page.  
		<br><br>
		For example, the user would write a class called com.acme.ConnectionFactory that has a method called getConnection.
		The user would then place this class on their application server so that the RazorSQL JDBC Bridge can
		call it.  In the Connection Wizard, the user would tell RazorSQL to use the Interface method with an
		Interface Class of com.acme.ConnectionFactory and Interface Method of getConnection.
		<br><br>
		If using the Driver option, the RazorSQL JDBC Bridge will obtain a connection to the database using the 
		passed in driver settings for each SQL statement that needs to be executed.
		<br><br>
		For more information, see the RazorSQL JDBC Bridge User's Guide in the help documentation.
