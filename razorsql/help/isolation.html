		<b>Transaction Isolation</b>
		<br><br>
		Use the Transaction Isolation option to set the transaction isolation level on the database
		connection for databases that support it.  The isolation level will only be set if it
		is supported by the database.  If it is not supported, RazorSQL will ignore the isolation
		level.
		<br><br>
		Listed below are the transaction isolation levels supported by RazorSQL in order
		from least restrictive to most restrictive.
		<br><br>
		<b>WARNING</b>: More restrictive isolation levels can result
			in row or table level locking for some databses, especially if
			auto-commit is set to off.  This can cause operations to hang
			when waiting for the lock to be released.
		<br><br>
		1. <b>Default</b>: Uses the default settings for the database.
		<br><br>
		2. <b>Read Uncommitted</b>: Allows dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom 
			reads.
		<br><br>
		3. <b>Read Committed</b>: Dirty reads are prevented. Non-repeatable reads and 
			phantom reads can occur.
		<br><br>
		4. <b>Repeatable Read</b>: Dirty reads and non-repeatable reads are prevented. Phantom
			reads can occur.
		<br><br>
		5. <b>Serialziable</b>: Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads are
			prevented.
