		<b>SQLite Enable Unicode Support</b>
		<br><br>
		On Windows systems, unicode is not enabled by default with the RazorSQL SQLite driver.
		To enable Unicode support, select the "Enable Unicode Support" checkbox when creating
		the SQLite connection profile or when connecting to an existing SQLite database via the
		"Connect" screen.
		<br><br>
		When Unicode support is enabled, RazorSQL needs to change the default code page for
		all command line communication with sqlite to be in UTF-8 encoding.  It also needs to
		UTF-8 encode any input sent to the SQLite command line program.  This can cause
		some performance loss.
