SID (site identifier) is an Oracle term.  The SID is a value used to identify a database.  
Previous to the release
of Oracle 8i, Oracle database instances were referred to by SID. 
Release 8i added service name functionality.  Service names
are used most often in a clustering environment, but can 
also apply to single instance database configurations.
