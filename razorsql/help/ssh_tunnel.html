		<b>SSH Tunnel Configuration</b>
		<br><br>
		An SSH tunnel allows RazorSQL to connect to a remote database via the SSH protocol.  
		<br><br>
		The benefits of an SSH tunnel are that SSH can be used to encrypt all communications to and
		from the server, and the server does not need to allow remote access to the database.  Connections
		to the server will be done via the SSH port, and once connected to the server over SSH, communications
		to the database server will be initiated from the server instead of the client desktop.
		<br><br>
		Not all hosting companies provide SSH tunneling.  Please check with your web host / database administrator
		to determine if SSH access is available for your account.
		<br><br>
		Many hosting companies do not allow remote database connections.  One of the preferred methods of connecting
		to remote databases in this case is to use SSH tunneling.
		<br><br><br>
		<strong>SSH Host: </strong>This is the host name of the SSH server.
		<br><br>
		<strong>SSH Port: </strong>This is the port for the SSH server.  This is usually 22.
		<br><br>
		<strong>SSH User: </strong>This is the name of the account used to logon to the SSH server.
		<br><br>
		<strong>SSH Password: </strong>This is the password of the account used to logon to the SSH server.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Local Port to Forward: </strong>When setting up an SSH tunnel, a local port is needed.  RazorSQL
			will forward communications on the local port via the SSH tunnel.  Enter a port value that is not used by another
			process, such as 5555.  When entering in the database host and port information on the main Add connection profile
			screen after setting up an SSH tunnel, make sure to set the host as localhost and the port as the local port value
			entered here.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Remote Database Host: </strong>This is the name of the database host to connect to.  If the database is on the same
		host as the SSH server, this would typically be localhost.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Remote Database Port: </strong>This is the port that the remote database is listening on.
