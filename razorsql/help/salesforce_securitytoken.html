		To interact with Salesforce.com, in addition to a login and password, Salesforce requires you to specify a 
		SecurityToken. You can obtain this from your profile in Salesforce.  Currently, you can obtain your
		security token by selecting the My Settings -> Personal -> Reset My Security Token option.  This will
		email the security token to you.
